     * The main motivation for this piece of software is to achieve maximum speed and offer
     * good quality of life while parsing files containing multiple JSON documents.
     *
     * Since we want to offer flexibility and not restrict ourselves to a specific file
     * format, we support any file that contains any valid JSON documents separated by one
     * or more character that is considered a whitespace by the JSON spec.
     * Namely: space, nothing, linefeed, carriage return, horizontal tab.
     * Anything that is not whitespace will be parsed as a JSON document and could lead
     * to failure.
     *
     * To offer maximum parsing speed, our implementation processes the data inside the
     * buffer by batches and their size is defined by the parameter "batch_size".
     * By loading data in batches, we can optimize the time spent allocating data in the
     * ParsedJson and can also open the possibility of multi-threading.
     * The batch_size must be at least as large as the biggest document in the file, but
     * not too large in order to submerge the chached memory.  We found that 1MB is
     * somewhat a sweet spot for now.  Eventually, this batch_size could be fully
     * automated and be optimal at all times.
